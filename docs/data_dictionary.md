## 2. Foundational Layer

### 2.1 Repository

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| repository_id | integer | YES | Primary key |
| name | string | YES | Full institutional name |
| url | string | YES | Base URL of the repository website |
| notes | string | NO | Free text notes |

______________________________________________________________________

### 2.2 Source

| repository_id | integer | YES | Foreign key to Repository |
| title | string | YES | Name of the source |
| type | string | YES | Source type — see §6.1 |
| coverage_from | integer | NO | Start year of source coverage |
| coverage_to | integer | NO | End year of source coverage |
| source_url | string | NO | URL of the source collection landing page |
| record_url_template | string | NO | URL template with `{placeholder}` tokens |

______________________________________________________________________

### 2.3 PlaceAuthority

Authoritative place identities seeded from logainm.ie or added manually. Not researcher conclusions — these are reference facts. The hierarchy is expressed as denormalised columns (flat schema) rather than a separate junction table.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| place_id | integer | YES | Synthetic primary key |
| logainm_id | integer | NO | logainm.ie numeric identifier. Unique where present; null for manually-added entities |
| name_en | string | YES | Canonical English place name |
| place_type | string | YES | Place type — see §6.10 |
| parent_name | string | NO | Name of the immediate parent entity (e.g. the DED under which this townland was fetched) |
| parent_id | integer | NO | logainm_id of the immediate parent |
| parent_type | string | NO | place_type of the immediate parent |
| ded_name | string | NO | Name of the District Electoral Division containing this place |
| ded_id | integer | NO | logainm_id of the DED |
| county_name | string | NO | Name of the county |
| county_id | integer | NO | logainm_id of the county |
| barony_name | string | NO | Name of the barony (null where not in logainm) |
| barony_id | integer | NO | logainm_id of the barony |
| civil_parish_name | string | NO | Name of the civil parish (null where not in logainm) |
| civil_parish_id | integer | NO | logainm_id of the civil parish |
| latitude | real | NO | WGS84 latitude |
| longitude | real | NO | WGS84 longitude |
| logainm_url | string | NO | Permalink to logainm.ie entry; null for manually-added entities |
| notes | string | NO | Free text — used for manually-added entities or variant notes |

**Hierarchy note:** A townland may lack barony and civil_parish values if logainm does not record them for that townland. This is a data quality characteristic of the source, not a model deficiency. The ded_id and county_id are typically populated for all townlands.

**Church parishes:** logainm.ie does not catalogue church (Catholic) parishes. These are added manually with `logainm_id = NULL`. Membership of a church parish is recorded by adding the townland rows with the `parent_type = 'church_parish'` where applicable — or more commonly queried via a researcher-maintained lookup outside the core schema.

### 3.2 Record event fields

Event attributes are stored directly on the `record` table rather than in a separate `recorded_event` table. Because every Record documents exactly one event, the 1:1 join was eliminated in schema v2.8.

The following fields on `record` carry the event data:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

## 4a. Review Layer

### 4a.1 Reviewer

A first-class entity representing any agent that creates or modifies conclusion-layer objects. See conceptual_model.md §7.1.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| reviewer_id | integer | YES | Primary key |
| name | string | YES | Human-readable identifier. Conventions: `pipeline:person_resolution`, `human:Mike`, `ai:claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| type | string | YES | Reviewer type — see §6.12 |
| notes | string | NO | Free text notes |
| created_at | timestamp | YES | When this Reviewer was registered. Default `NOW()`. |

Two Reviewers are seeded at `init` time: `pipeline:system` (reviewer_id=1) for all automated pipeline conclusions, and `human:unknown` (reviewer_id=2) as a fallback for unattributed edits.

______________________________________________________________________

### 4a.2 ConclusionLog

An append-only record of every creation, modification, or deletion of a conclusion-layer object. The log is permanent; individual entries are never updated or deleted. See conceptual_model.md §7.2.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| log_id | integer | YES | Primary key |
| reviewer_id | integer | YES | Foreign key to Reviewer — who made this change |
| action | string | YES | Action taken — see §6.13 |

| old_value | string | NO | Previous value serialised as text. Null on `create`. |
| new_value | string | NO | New value serialised as text. Null on `delete`. |
| reason | string | NO | Free-text explanation. Required culturally for `human` and `ai` reviewers; may be null for `pipeline` creates where the reason is implicit in the algorithm. |
| change_group_id | string | NO | UUID grouping all log entries that form a single logical researcher action. For example: moving a RecordedPerson from one Person to another produces a delete entry and a create entry sharing the same `change_group_id`. Null for isolated single-entry actions. |
| session_ref | string | NO | Lightweight session identifier. A pipeline run may store its git commit hash; a Claude session its session ID; a human session a date string or note. Does not reference a separate session table. |
| created_at | timestamp | YES | When this log entry was written. Default `NOW()`. |

| Event.place_id | → PlaceAuthority | Authoritative place for this Event |
| Relationship.recorded_relationship_ids | → RecordedRelationship | RecordedRelationships concluded to evidence this Relationship |
| place_record | Record → PlaceAuthority | Scored conclusion: this recorded place string refers to this authority |

### Scoring columns on linkage junction tables

The four primary linkage junction tables (`person_recorded_person`, `event_record`, `relationship_recorded_relationship`, `place_record`) carry:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| score | real | NO | Similarity score in [0.0, 1.0]; null for manually-asserted linkages |
| score_version | string | NO | Algorithm version that produced the score; null when score is null |
